# Object Orientated Programming

# Classes and Objects

  - Object Orientated Programming revolves around classes and objects.
  - You can also think of a class as a blueprint from which you can instantiate an individual object.
  - A class contains fields (also called variables) and methods, which represent the state and behavior of the object, respectively.
  - Note that in Java, we use fields to store data, while we use methods to perform operations.

```
class ClassName {
// fields
// methods
}
```
```
Object: car
State: color, brand, weight, model
Behavior: break, accelerate, turn, change gears
```

# Benefits of OOP

  - Re-usability - Code can be reused through inheritance, meaning a team does not have to write the same code multiple times.
  - Security - Using encapsulation and abstraction complex code is hidden, software maintenance is easier and internet protocols are protected.
  - Flexibility - Polymorphism enables classes to carry out the same behaviour but in different ways.
  - Readability - following accepted OOP principles makes otherwise complex code easier to understand.

# OOP Alternatives

 - Logical programming

# Four Pillars of OOP

  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
